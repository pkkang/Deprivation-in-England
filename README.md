# Deprivation-in-England
This repository contains the code used to create a database about the political representation of electoral wards in England and their deprivation.
The Indices of Deprivation data is published by the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government. 
# Getting started
The majority of data about the councillors was web scraped from the council websites. It wasn't possible to create a web scraper that accounted for all the websites and so about a third of councillors were found manually.
